				Welcome to The Open Bank Projectâ€™s Social Finance application.
			</p>
			<br />

            <!--
			<p>
				This application allows
				bank account holders to choose with whom they would like to share their
				transaction data. For instance, an individual might share their bank
				account with their accountant; a company with their directors and/or
				shareholders; an NGO or government department with the public.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Account holders can preserve privacy and commercial confidentiality
				by using aliases to protect the real names.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Once connected, account holders can also benefit from other applications
				that use the Open Bank Project API.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				See the left panel for examples of organisations raising the bar of
				financial transparency !
